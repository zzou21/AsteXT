The AsteXT project aims to build a story classifier using Natural Language Processing and the Transformers architecture to identify trends in Asian American short stories. By building a model that could register a story's genre, main themes, common word choices, and publication year, this model hopes to find a shift in literary trends from 20th-century Asian American short stories to those in the 21st century, especially those originally published online.
